##  Overview
In the travel industry, **flight prices fluctuate almost every hour** — driven by countless factors like airline, route, duration, and demand.  
This project aims to predict flight prices using **Machine Learning** to enable smarter travel planning and data-driven business decisions.

##  Project Summary
Over the past few days, I worked on building an **end-to-end Airline Price Prediction System**, transforming raw flight data into an interactive web application.

###  Key Steps
- **Data Cleaning & EDA:** Explored flight price data to identify patterns and dependencies across features such as journey date, airline, duration, and total stops.  
- **Feature Selection:** Identified and selected the most impactful predictors to improve model accuracy and interpretability.  
- **Model Building:** Tested multiple algorithms and finalized the **Random Forest Regressor** for its strong, consistent performance.  
- **Model Compression:** Optimized deployment by saving the model in a compressed `.pkl.gz` format for faster loading.  
- **Deployment:** Built an elegant, interactive **Streamlit app** that predicts flight prices based on user inputs.

##  Tech Stack
- **Programming Language:** Python  
- **Libraries:** NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Streamlit  
- **Model:** Random Forest Regressor  
- **Deployment:** Streamlit Cloud  

---

##  How It Works
1. Users enter flight details (airline, source, destination, total stops, journey date, etc.).
2. The app preprocesses the input using the same transformations as the training phase.
3. The trained model predicts the **estimated flight price**.
4. The result is displayed with an interactive and modern UI/UX.

---
##  Results
- Achieved **85%+ model accuracy** with Random Forest Regressor.  
- Created a **visually appealing** Streamlit app featuring a background image, styled layout, and smooth UX.  
- Bridged the gap between notebook experimentation and real-world deployment.

---

##  Learnings
- Improved understanding of **feature selection** and **model interpretability**.  
- Learned how to **deploy compressed models** efficiently using .pkl.gz.  
- Enhanced practical skills in **Streamlit UI design** and app hosting.
